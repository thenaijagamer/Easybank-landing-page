## My Process

### Built With

I focused on a variety of skills in this project, including:

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- Git for version control

Additionally, I employed sprite SVG icons and leveraged entrance animations from animista.net to enhance the project's visual appeal. One unique aspect was implementing the functionality of displaying the navigation bar on phone screen sizes without using JavaScript; instead, I utilized HTML and CSS to achieve this.

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained insights into manipulating SVG icons into a sprite file, expanding my knowledge within the realm of SVG optimization and usage in web development.

### Continued Development

In future iterations, I plan to enhance the project further by incorporating accessibility features and advanced animations using JavaScript for advanced DOM manipulation.

### Useful Resources

- [Animista.net](https://animista.net) - For entrance animations
- Autoprefixer - Assisted in vendor prefixing CSS for cross-browser compatibility
